Text summarization is a common problem in natural language processing. There
exists a wealth of algorithms for summarizing text, for example the
widely used TextRank~\cite{mihalcea2004textrank}.

However, even though these summarizers work well for reasonably short texts
like news articles and scientific papers, they perform quite poorly on longer texts like books.
Therefore we're interested in trying to summarize a book, or other long text.
