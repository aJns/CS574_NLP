Text summarization is a common problem in NLP. However, the large number of existing algorithms tend to focus on short articles and papers rather than long texts like books. Therefore, we propose a novel weighted, recursive summarization method that could ultimately be integrated into any existing abstractive or extractive method, for the purpose of summarising long texts. Promising results are found from BLEU and ROUGE scores, but with limitations in sentence coherence.
