\section{Introduction}
In this report, the status update of the CS574 NLP project is presented. An overview is given of the progress made since the project proposal four weeks previously. The main work done was to conduct additional literature research, create a dataset, attempt to implement summarisation algorithms and to evaluate them. Based on these results, the project will be rounded off in the remaining two weeks.

\section{Dataset}
A dataset was collected from the internet of 10 novels and a play, with at least three summaries each. The books are mainly fictional classics, due to their popularity on summary resources and often the expiration of their copyright. Most of the summaries are sourced from CliffsNotes, SparkNotes and GradeSaver. The books and summaries both vary quite vastly in length. All the documents were saved as or converted to text files, to allow consistency and ease of manipulation in Python.
