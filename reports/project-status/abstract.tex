Text summarization is a common problem in natural language processing. There
exists a wealth of existing algorithms for summarizing text, for example the
widely used TextRank~\cite{mihalcea2004textrank}.

However, even though these summarizers work well for reasonably short texts
like news articles, they perform quite poorly on longer text, like books.
Therefore we're interested in trying to summarize a book, or other long text.
