\section{Problem setup and motivation}

The problem we want to solve is summarising a novel or other very long piece of
text, for example a screenplay. We think this is an interesting problem to
solve, because summarising of short articles is common, but algorithms that can
summarize long pieces are rarer. Thus we have a place to start (short article
summary), but still have to come up with new solutions.
